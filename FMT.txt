Easy going, easy to get along with fun loving and loves my quiet times doing what I enjoy. I am a what you see is what you get type of person and it takes a lot to get me angry. I am tactfully honest. But I do make people earn my attention. I know it‚Äôs valuable and I don't bite my tongue about certain things other than that I'm just ME.
===================================================
FORD 
Well I'm a single dad, I'm a private doctor working with  the US Army on a contract
I am specialize on bullet injury taking good care of the wounded soldiers, I have been a widower for the past 4 years after i lost my wife. I'm easy to get along with fun loving and loves my quiet times doing what I enjoy, it takes a lot to get me angry. I am honest man. I don't bite my tongue about certain things other than that I'm just me 
========================================================

Would you consider a relationship anytime soon with someone who's ready to settle down??

Well for me I'm looking for a friend first and see where it leads but it have to be someone that is serious, confident, purposeful, persistent, smart, honest, I'm a person that looks beyond what may be obvious...character is worth more than flashiness.
==============================================SITEEND====================

Does age matter in a relationship?

I'm 44 years old and to me age is just a number never matter when it come to love and love don't care if you are old or young. What matter is happiness and the joy of the soul and what you feel make you what you will be. 
=======================================================================

What sort of relationship you seek for??

Okay that‚Äôs cool I seek a relationship where both of us are worth the same as humans and partners who commit to one another for love by own free will.. A relationship built upon trust, communication, respect, support, fairness, companionship, sharing ideas, sharing good and bad moments as well. 

I expect being together forever and grow old raising a beautiful happy, loving family. I want a sincere and eternal relationship that each is willing to share everything. No lies, no secret. Be there for the other in both good and bad time. To achieve that, a true friendship and a true love must exist.
======================================================================
 Well I work as a building contractor. Specialize in contraction of Roads, Houses, Bridges, Stores and Malls.. 

What you do for living ?

Well I work as a building contractor and i have been to many developing country due to the nature of my job. I own a construction company that builds and construct Roads, Bridges, Houses and Stores Mall.
 And I'm currently in Dubai  UAE on a business trip, I have been here for about two months now I thought is should let you know this on time. Well I hope this doesn't discourage you from us getting to know each other ?
===================================================================

What are you looking in a man?
I'm looking for a woman who is understanding, caring, loving, and a woman who will be there for me. Someone who is willing to give. In some relationships only one person gives, but this is not what I want. A relationship must take both people working together, and loving one another, doing whatever it takes to make things work. 

Wow Impressive, I like that I feel we both on want the same, I'm looking for a woman who is understanding, caring, loving, and a woman who will be there for me. Someone who is willing to give. In some relationships only one person gives but this is not what I want, giving is not all about money  but paying attention to your partner means a lot too. A relationship must take both people working together, and loving one another, doing whatever it takes to make things work. 

Communication is very important to me. And I want someone who like to do the simple things, such as a walk in the park, hand in hand, spending a lot of time together, getting to know about one another. Honesty is very important and sincerity....

=========================================================================

I'm a pretty easy going guy. It take a lot to get me angry. I want that in a woman as well. It is all about communication and communication is not just talking but also being able to listen. Not just hear the person but listen and absorb and understand what the person is conveying to you.. I love individualism. 

Don't become what you think I will like, be yourself and let me like you!!! With this as a foundation all the trust and honesty falls into place. It becomes a given and not something you have to look for or ask for.. So now i really have to ask...Are u that special woman ???
=========================================================================

I consider myself to be very simple. I believe that women needs to be treated with respect and as a equal partner in a relationship, but all I seem to find is the ones that does not know how to respond to that or is entrusting to it. I feel like u should treat somebody with respect and like they are a person not a piece of meat or whatever. 

I am the type of person who wants somebody to feel wanted not just as a trophy. I am a very affectionate person and I love to cuddle, I like to show somebody how I feel not just telling them. I love to be close to somebody whether it is in the bed on the couch or wherever..
====================================================================

Well firstly thanks so much for the interest shown in me,i would like to say what a beautiful woman you are. I am ready to start the next chapter in my life with someone who is ready for a serious relationship...So here I am just one little fish in this big pond seeing what else is swimming around. Could be that you know exactly what this little fish is looking for.... if so you may just cast your line and get a bite

=====================================================================

Baby I'm very relationship oriented and I believe life is to short to waste. When I am in a relationship I am committed, honest, and loyal. I think that falling in love is always a good thing, even if it doesn't work out. There is always something to learn from being with someone, and happy times and memories should be cherished.
=============================================================

What Your Romantic Ideas?

My romantic date is when we can chill @ my house and i will have to cook ur favorite meal for u and when i lead u to the diner it would be surrounded with a white sheet and also with red roses and also with white candles to really show u how much u mean to me ..

And then there would also be a bottle of champagne and when we are done with that we can watch a movie and also listen to slow music and then when we are watching a movie i would just kiss u on ur head to tell u how grateful i am to have u in my presence and then we can both have a bubble bath together and then we can do some naughty things to each other lol....
==============================================================

You seem like you are very down to earth and laid back woman, and that is good. It's good to see you are affectionate and like showing your feelings and age doesn't really matter to me cos its just a #.

I believe that partners are 100% equal in a relationship and both should be able to feel they can trust each other 100% at all times. I feel that any man who ever disrespects a woman is not a man at all. 

I am affectionate also and I have no trouble showing it for the right woman in public or private.

Baby i love to cuddle while watching a good movie, when were in bed, I love to hug and kiss my woman at anytime and anywhere it could be a store,mall or just on a sidewalk. 

You are looking for long term, I am looking for something permanent and I know it takes time and a lot of good effort to form a good relationship.

I want a woman to be my best friend at all times, my sweetheart, love of my life, my partner and my soul mate all wrapped up into one lovely woman . 

I would be all of that for her and more,I would love her with all of my heart and have nothing but good feelings for her. She should be a very caring person, with a lot of good feelings, be honest, reliable,pleasant personality and have a sense of humor.
====================================================================

What's being single like?

To me being single it's both, a sense of accomplishment , independence, and free.Sometimes easier to make decisions, which may be good, I think; yet it is also hard because of the lack of emotional support, very lonely all the time. It okay's because I can concentrate my energy toward my career and life goals.However, I always want someone with whom I can share my dream and thoughtfulness and she also wants to share hers with me.It is very important to have a balance in life.
==================================================================

What is love to you?

To me, love is a feeling of selflessness, of no more me and me, but you and me.Which implies thinking of the other person and yourself too of course, but many times willingness to sacrifice oneself for the one that you love.Love is giving and forgiving. Give without requiring a return. Forgive no matter how painful it is or how stupid the mistake is.Always think and do whatever to make the other happy...
==============================================================

How do you treat your Man?.....

I treat my woman like my most precious gift from heaven other than my family. I give my woman the place she has in my life, a unique one, my beloved and admired one.I adore her and look forward to make her dreams come true along with mine.With unconditional love. With sincerity, honesty, fairness, respect and care. These are my values that I apply to every person as well.
=================================================================

Have you ever hit a man before fight your man or been beating up by your man or love one? 

I have never done such to any woman in my life and i will never do such cos woman are God gift to man and born of the born and flesh of the flesh from Woman and why should i hit Gift from God..Woman are meant to be protect love care for and without Women there is no man and my father is a man and i am willing love her for ever if i find that woman for me.mother tells me woman are the cloth men put on cos they are like a Egg in the hand of God given to man as the ever lasting Gift as a present to man.. ====================================================================

Would you hit your Man for any reasons?

NO, that's a big NO to me.. I rather walk out or leave if it is the only way out from hitting a woman.. So when talking, discussing, explaining, requesting,demanding and everything else fails to communicate an idea, need or desire,people need a space and time out to cool down, and look for a possible different solution to the problem when anger is under control.

I am one who strongly believes in respect and that without respect, you can‚Äôt experience true love and generate a healthy relationship. I believe in a smaller ‚Äúwow‚Äù when it is first a friendship and then a larger ‚ÄúWo00000000w‚Äù later as it evolves into a Beautiful Loving committed relationship. I believe it‚Äôs not just what you are like on the outside, but more about what you are like in the inside. I‚Äôm seeking friendship first, (no game playing please) with someone who appreciates some of the same temperaments and interests I enjoy 

=================================================================

In the best relationships, partners are committed to bringing out the best in each other and have the others best interests at hear. To help make you all you can be. To come along side you as you as you fulfill your own destiny. It can only be delayed but can never be diminish 

Baby I‚Äôm trying not to ramble here for you but I am looking for the "One". What does that mean to me? She is the person that you can't wait until she comes home from work so you can kiss her and sit down and relax in front of the TV or go out and spend an evening together. 

The person that just calls to see how your day is going but knows that it just got much better because you are talking to each other. She gives you a lift when you are down and can always make you laugh because you know each other so well.
=================================================================

Do you like public intimacy?

For me I like public intimacy I Like to kiss My Mrs Right in the Public or Private to show her how much i love her

=============================================================

Are you the kind of woman  that easily gets angry or upset with Your partner?

Well as for me some time we and it depend on what the situation might be..i am a easy and calm man and very simple heart man and i easily forgive and forget,when am upset or mad at my love one i just move far away for some moment and some time i just listen to soul music to make my pain move off and i hardly get mad or upset and i give all and i open my heart and i will let her know when am sad or upset and then tell her are wrong and then we kiss and hug and mmm might make love in a happy way =============================================================

Are you a Christian and Do you Believe in God?
Yes am a Christian and I Believe in God and Am a Devoted Man I always go to Church to Pray to God cos he is my Creator... 
===============================================================

Tell me the things you like doing and things you want to do? 

For me i love treating people the way i want to be treated and love making people smile..i hate lies i hate games i hate cheat and i hate greedy people selfish people..i love been open and love meeting new people with grate instinct.i am a free heart man love dancing and singing love comedy show or tv show and i love helping people given them bright future and advice people.i love eating and love smiling hahaa am very simple ===============================================================

Why do you want a Man in your life ??

Well for me i want a Woman I will share My life with, to be there for her, to love her, respect her.Because I am a man and I want to take care the woman I love
=========================================================

Do you ever consider settling down in a committed relationship with a man you love that will lead to ever lasting love life..?


Yes if find that true heart love, Yes am Ready to settle down with that God Sent. God knows my heart that any woman i love or give my life to i will adore her cherish her care for her and love her like never before.
============================================================

Do you believe in commitment in a Relationship..? 

Like i said earlier i am willing and ready to settle down and in any happy relationship commitment is the key to the success of happy home when both are committed to each other both can make a happy life,with good communicate. sending letters chatting all time knowing good time and bad time of each other,making each other smile and happy,and with this you are making a grate life with each other.
================================================================

What interests you to me ?

I'm interested in you because for what you tell me, you have the personality, and values that I'm looking for in a woman, and very important to me, you are interested in me, so I believe there is good chemistry between you and me.
=====================================================

Caring partners are aware of each other's boundaries, need for personal space, and vulnerabilities. They do not take each other, or the relationship, for granted.To love someone is to understand each other, to laugh together, to smile with your heart and to trust one another. One important thing is to let each other go if you can't do this.

Love is like a wonderful feeling of compassion and satisfaction. It should be given respect and trust and it should receive that love back. The best proof of love is trust. True love is the greatest thing that you can experience it can weather any storm. Loving, trusting and respecting each other totally can bring you to true love and happiness

I want someone that can simply lay in bed with my head on her chest and our legs interlocked for hours and talk about what's on your mind. She is your best friend, your lover, your equal and if lucky your Wife and If I didn't scare you by being so serious and this sounds like something that would interest you then we could probably hit it off if you are up for it.

I'm not afraid to go for it and this is what I want from life because I deserve the best. I am opening up to you because I read what you had to say and I think you are the best. 

You have high standards and that's usually because you expect to get what you give from a relationship.I feel that we have broken the ice and have found some very common grounds between us.
======================================================

What do you do for fun?

I enjoy simple things such as  riding bicycles listening to different kinds of music: rock in general, jazz, some country music, I like watching Good movies too. I like reading news on the  internet, traveling and taking pictures.I like some outdoor activities as well.
==========================================================================

What your Favorite color?....
My favorite Color is Red and also black cos Red signify true love and happiness. Why black looks cool on me 
===========================================================================

What your Favorite Dish?......
My Favorite Dish is Seafoodm{Spicy Prawns with Coconut,Baked Salmon with a Creamy Avocado Sauce}
===========================================================================

Baby i really appreciate all that we been saying and i also think that u are so beautiful and also gorgeous and im a man who is very down to earth and i think u have really touched my soft spot ... I want to let you know that since we started sending each other text you have been all I can think about. Is this really happening to me?? Could I have found my true love in you? Well baby, I pray so because you have opened up a part of my heart that will not let you go. 

You are so special to me and I can only pray that you feel the same way. I know that once we are together we can start building a stronger foundation for what we now share. I want us to grow and learn from one another and always keep God first. If we do that then I know He will bless us and our relationship. 

I want someone to grow old with...I am looking for that lifetime love that lasts always and I want to share that with you. I believe that we can make this work because our feelings are already strong and we have yet to meet face to face. I am a very giving person and I plan to give you my all if you prove deserving of it and I feel that you are. So baby let's take this thing to the next level and prove to everyone that TRUE LOVE is not dead. 

I will do my best to make you happy and support you in everything you do. I want to be your best friend, your lover, your Husband and the one you trust with your deepest secrets. I Like you baby and know that I will always be there for you no matter what.
=============================================================

I want someone that can simply lay in bed with my head on her chest and our legs interlocked for hours and talk about what's on your mind. She is your best friend, your lover, your equal and if lucky your Wife and If I didn't scare you by being so serious and this sounds like something that would interest you then we could probably hit it off if you are up for it.
=======================================================

To talk about Trust: Partners are able to confide in each other openly, knowing their confidences will be respected.They are able to discuss anything together and are not afraid to be vulnerable. They can openly express their feelings and know they are safe to open up to their partner.

never have doubt not for once no matter what people tells about your man all you need is to sit him down and let him knows and do this with passion and if it is true he will beg for forgiveness and if not he tells you the truth even can wear on it. 
==========================================================

Baby I'm not only looking for my life partner but also my best friend. I believe that every relationship starts with a great friendship.I am an honest and caring person and I hope you would be too. I believe honesty is the best policy. I like to experience new things.Im ready to find true love,however, I feel like something is missing, and that something is having a relationship with a great woman with whom I can love and be loved....unconditionally, romantically, intimately
====================================================

Expressiveness: partners in a healthy relationship say what they feel, need, and desire in an assertive, rather than aggressive or blaming, manner. Feeling secure in the relationship allows you to be honest knowing that you won't be judged or criticized for your feelings.open up to yourself hard feelings,tells your pains and shear them together in a perfect manner and make sure it does not get over you,take away proudness in ur relationship coz you are both one.
===================================================

Thank you, What more can a man say to the woman who opened her heart to him, allowing him to feel the warmth of her love across the great distance that separates them? You truly have no idea what I feel for you.
=====================================================

I try to put this feeling into words, but fail miserably. This feeling of being both scared and at peace, of having both butterflies and a sense of calm, is a feeling that I have only dreamed about. As the days continue to pass, my love for you continues to grow. I never thought I had the capacity to love anybody as much as I love you right now. Yet, my love for you continues to mature, growing beyond the realm of my heart. It seems that you have become the fiber of my soul, the very reason for my existence.

===================================================

Staying Power: Couples in a committed relationship keep their bond strong through tough times by being there for each other. By choosing to love one another even when they may not feel like it. Love feels good but sometimes we need to make a choice to love, this is true maturity.can break you and can make you,stay strong in each other give you a better foundation =====================================================

DEVOTED!!!

Baby, I'm forever devoted to our relationship together. You are with every touch everything I have ever wanted. I sit and wonder just how all of this came about. We were just carrying on with our lives when all of a sudden it happened; we fell helplessly in love with each other.

I still remember the first day you entered my life, I knew right then that there was certainly something special about you, what I didn't completely know yet was that you are the woman who would turn my world inside out. I can't wait until we are able to spend each and every moment together.

Thank you for making all of my dreams come true, Baby, you have meant more to me than anyone ever. I love you because you are the only person who can make me smile when I am having the worst day. I love you because in your eyes I see a woman who will Love me more than anyone no matter what. I love you because you will do anything to keep me safe without even thinking twice. I love you most of all because you are my one and only, my soul mate. We belong together, Baby, and I couldn't be any happier. I love you with every breath I take, and every beat of my heart.
=======================================================

Support: Partners in a good relationship offer each other encouragement, comfort and acceptance. It's not about what you can do for me, it's about what can I do for you. Build up and edify each other.for better for worse,in good time and in bad time,stay strong inlove with each other and stand with each other like a back bone always gat each others back all ways,financially,socially,physically and spiritually stay strong and never let material,gold and silver money or any other thing run ur relationship coz they are nothing but a life materials
====================================================

I believe it was because we needed to experience what love wasn't but we thought it was in order to recognize what love really is..well i will stop here for now and i hope you write me back to tell me your feelings..Love you now and Forever
===============================================

Today I need to express exactly what I am feeling...I have surrounded myself with mistery, candles and poetry to keep me off the ceiling.I am writing these words with you in mind,But this love is out of this world,i read your mail and they put me through and bring me out of pains and now i feel so free i admire you always sweet Baby let me tell you how i feel about you,believe it or not this is from my heart and this is the truth about me,angel when i first saw your pics the first thing that came straight to my mind was God bless me with this angel in this pics,i dont care if she is short, tall, slim or fat,big or small deaf or disable..for long time every night and day i pray for my soul-mate wherever she is God save her for me and bring her to me savely,kindly God brought you to me coz you are the most beautiful star in the sky,you shine like a sunlight,you bless me with your beauty,i got carried away by your look in the pics,my thought could not go off your pics,i feel you in me deep down of my heart.

The emissions is so strong,tears of joy rain from my eyes,i feel blessed in side of me,the worms in my to my move up and down,my heart bit so fast,i wanna be were you are,i was carried away by the storm of love,this is more than illusion,i want to show you the side of love you never know, I feel for you,fall for you and trip for you,now i am talking to you,i am speechless,i feel the happiness of love in me,i am here 

you are there but our soul are together,i try to speak and the words never come out,i speak words from miles baby you never hear me but i feel for you from miles and i know you can see that in me,if i die i want to die for love,if i cry i want to cry for love,if i swim i want to swim in the ocean of love,spaces in my heart,you fell it up,sorrow in my heart you take them away,pains in my body you change it and it become joy..wooooow baby you made me a brand new man,i have stay too long,angel carry me along, want to walk in your way,i will love to play your game,don't wonder.

Why i speak this way baby love don't cost a thing,yes i don't know you well and i have not see you on cam and you have not see me as well but baby this is true..they say love is blind .love can make you and can break you,very wonderful and powerful,full of happiness ,if it come never loose that chance to go with it coz it is the perfect life soul could have..love, love the whole world need this and never let it go once you got it..now i am calling for you coz you knock me off my fit,and you stole my heart and i never complain coz am happy with it...

When I saw you, I was afraid of meeting you.When I met you, I was afraid of talking to you.When I talked to you, I was afraid to love you.Now that I love you, ?am afraid of losing you .Love is like sunshine. It brings a golden glow to its beholder's face. And a warm feeling all over their body.

It awakens souls and opens eyes.Time has passed but my love for you will never diminish.You are my first and the last love.. It awakens souls and opens eyes. And when its over, it leaves billions of small memories called stars.love,trust,emission and the true love of my heart..To remind the world, that it still exists.Wish I was your blanket, I wish I was your bed, I wish I was your pillow underneath your head,wish i am the cloth you wear,i wish i was your tooth brush,i wish i was your under wear,wish you are mine,am tired of staying alone, I wanna be around you, I wanna hold you tight & be the lucky person who kisses you good night..Even the richest king can't compare to the greatest treasure I have in you. He may own things that I can only dream of. But he doesn't know what I've got...someone like you.I wake filled with thoughts of you. My affection for you grows each and everyday. I am totally addicted to you, and you're the only drug that kept me from dying. I pray hard each day, just to hope that you and I can be in a relationship that is more than just friends someday. For now, I've written this letter to declare my love for you and I will be right here waiting for you.I'm so in love with you.. I get this warm sensual feeling every time I think of you. When I sleep at night, all I can dream about is you. I wish I could hold you in my arms. I dream of the day when I could kiss you passionately on your soft sweet lips and listen to your heart beating because it's sweet music to my ears.

Talking about who i am, I am that easy going type,open minded and a good listener .I laugh a lot and try to make people around me all the time happy.My hobbies are too many but to mentioned a few; sports,watching romantic movies, going for walks, playing with kids, listening to all types of music, making love at the beach, dancing in the dark etc. My favorite movies are romantic movies, eating habits: just about anything.My lips are kissable which is one of my most attractive features.I don't smoke or but i am a social drinker.I always make sure to share the little that I have with someone and I'm also satisfied with whatever I 've.Also when it comes to sex/lovemaking,i think both of us should play an equal role.My woman should be able to satisfy me during love making and am not afraid to give her all what she want in love making till she is drunk with my love.To add a few I am not a racist and i am very romantic.I will go to where ever and who ever i find to be my soul mate.I love always being around my woman and letting her know how much i love her through my physical touch on her body with my sensitive parts.What I am looking for is someone who will get to know me ,who will love me forever and be there for me ,who is willing to merge her soul with mine to result in what is called fate then later merge her heart with mine and that will be marriage.And then I get to live with her in his humble abode for ever and start a family with.I am single and I am looking for someone who understands love and know what love is.Someone who is not ready to play with my heart.Someone who will value my heart and life when i give her my heart.Because i am the type who gives his heart to the one i am in love with in a relationship.And this has been my believe that relationship is built on trust ,honesty ,faithfulness and love.Also passion,caring for one another,the ability to compromise and grow.That is what i call true love.And this include being there for each other through thick and think ,in good times and in bad times.willing to share your last penny to save your partners life in a dying situation .True love, an emotion so strong that you would give up everything. To just feel it once, to know that you are part of something special. To know that you can feel what love really is; to know, to feel, to love."To love someone is to understand each other, to laugh together, to smile with your heart and to trust one another. One important thing is to let each other go if you can't do this."True love is a covenant that we build on a strong foundation. It is with true love as it is with ghosts; everyone talks about it, but few have seen it. I promise to make my one and only the most happiest woman on earth if only she's willing to accept me as part of her.I will be there whenever she needs me and promise never to do anything to hurt her feeling. I will love her just the way she is, being blind, disable, deaf or dumb or whatever category that she falls in.And what I have known and believed all this while is that Death can not stop true love, it can only delay it for a little while.I am ever willing to do anything to have my true love forever and sail to the end of the sea with her.I promised to be the man of her dreams because I'm not going to let her down, I assure her my whole heart. I can't tell if that special person is you but why don't you write me and let's find out what happens.

Free Swager Talk.............................
I had to rush down there to make sure get better cos i am the only child and she is the only one left for me at this time,i lost my dad when i was 10

I want someone to love me for me and me alone and not love me for what i do for them cos i give it all when it comes to a relationship and always there for my woman,if she does this,i will treat her like no man as ever treated her and make her my one and only Love.

mostly importantly i want to get married to a caring, down to earth, romantic,

God fearing hubby soonest. the main thing is life that will make me happy is to have a loving, passionately hubby and a happy family as well. am religiously indined, God fearing , and believe jesus die for me on the cross of calvary. i will be returning back to the states soonest. but trust and massive care is mandatory in every relationship and i really want that.

Men with great achievements are respected not for the things they really do but for the choices they make .i have decide to be a simple ,loving and impacting person who apart from the achievements of great feet i have planned to have also plan to have a very loving wife and family ..for this is the secret to happiness in life

if love were music as it is said pls play on and let it serenade my soul as nothing in the world compares to love...this is the way i want my soulmate to think of me and to think when it comes to love...she should be simple in thoughts,resolute and principled in doings,smooth in talks and loving to others....to me she must be caring and get to know me as only those who love me can know me.

Love is not about finding the right person, but creating a right relationship. It's not about how much love you have in the beginning but how much love you build till the end The bad things in life open your eyes to the good things you weren't paying attention to before

If it is meant to be, our hearts will find each other when we meet. And if our hearts melt together so will our bodies and souls. Then every word and every touch will fuel our passion flame. I will be yours, you will be mine, and we will be one

What is more important to you the love you share, the memories you have or the lover? Give love a chance to swallow you up. Don't just think it will happen in a instant, it will suprise you before you know it, but it will be the most rewarding experience you will ever have

The beating of my heart is a drum, and it's lost, and it's looking for a rhythm like you

I don't need anyone to take advantage of my weaknesses or my strengths, I need someone who will appreciate me for everything that I am

My past relationship was bad ever since then i have been single and scared to fall inlove but now i am willing and ready for a second chance.

I am easygoing,open mined and i know how to treat my woman and make her feel good,i gives to her every love she wants and always there for her when she needs a shoulder to lean on

A relationship is like a train. If one passes, then the next one will come. I'm sure and if you get off the train, you'll realize that everything is the same I may not be your first, but to be your last would be perfect

When I found your profile, I felt as if my heart found its destination

Baby Don't let false love fool you, but don't let real love pass you by.i feel like i am your true love

Don't use your eyes to look for love for it's your heart that knows it. Let yourself make mistakes and do learn from this. It is from this that you will accumulate your knowledge as to whether the person met is the one or not

The easy part of life is finding someone to love. The hard part is finding someone to love you back

I don't believe in love at first sight anymore, I cried too much over it to believe in it, I think I need glasses to see accurately 'cause I can never really see the right one for me,but yours is Different i feel like you are the one for me cos the way you sound to me makes me feel so special i have never felt the way i am feeling now before

I would give up anything just to be with you i may not be the most attractive, i may not say all the right words, but when you see me, you know i'm the one that can make you smile, laugh, and cry all at the same time:)

The best thing about loving and being hurt is that you get to know what true love really is. For as gold is tested in fire, and so will love be perfected in pain

To love someone is to understand each other, to laugh together, to smile with your heart and to trust one another. One important thing is to let each other go if you can't do this



I do cherish you, from the depths of my soul, it's beyond my control, I've waited so long, to say this to you, if you're asking do I love you this much, I do



Baby you know True love doesn't just fill heart, it overflows into your whole body and soul
True love is what I feel for you, for you have my soul, heart and passion, those can only be felt again when I desire you
I promised myself I'd never forget you or feel for any girl the way i am feeling for you right now



If there were no words, no way to speak, I would still hear you. If there were no tears, no way to feel inside, I'd still feel for you. And even if the sun refused to shine, even if romance ran out of rhyme, you would still have my heart until the end of time. You're all I need



Baby it's difficult to find someone like you; it's like opening a hundred shells under the sea to find one pearl. But finding you makes the dive worth it



if it is meant for us to be it will be and nothing will ever tears us apart but if it is not meant to be maybe it's a blessing in disguise



Baby my heart has already found it's way you. I want you and no one else. I think we should try and make this work. You have to know you're the one, and only one I want. Not only are you perfect for me, you're the perfect friend and I hope we can and will be more. I could never ask for better then what we have had. I am hoping you're feeling the same way because my heart is set on you, and only you



Baby i know that you are not perfect and nor can I claim to be either, but please believe me, when I say that I want to be by your side, to hold your hand, to treasure you in the morning and in the noon-tide, to be next to you, to be held close to your heart now and for the rest of my living years, to comfort you, dry your tears and calm your most frightening fears, to fight your battles and show no shame to scream my love for you out loud all over the land



I guarantee that we'll have tough times and I guarantee that at some point one or both of us will want to get out. But I also guarantee that if I don't ask you to be mine, I'll regret it for the rest of my life cause I know in my heart you're the only one for me



I prayed for a person to love me. I must've prayed very hard, because God didn't give me a person - He has given me an angel,and Guess who the angel is,U



Maybe God wants us to meet a few wrong people before finding the right one, so that when we finally find the right one, we will know how to be grateful



If you open up my heart, you'll find a cupboard so full of love that you would never have to starve

I don't regret anything from my past, no matter how bad it seems in hindsight, because every little step I took was leading me right to you



Babylove I'll always hold you dear to my heart, and promise u never shall we part. You will always be my other half and im gone keep loving you till the end of time 



I sought for love, but love ran away from me.. I sought my soul, but my soul I couldn't see. Then I sought you, and I found all three
